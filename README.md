Aurora [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gethe/Aurora.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Gethe/Aurora)
======

Aurora is an addon which restyles the default Blizzard interface to a clean, minimalistic theme which is consistent across the entire UI.

A lot of time has been spent on not only basic development and updates, but also refining and perfecting the appearance of each window and every frame.

A single color, that either matches your current class or is a color of your choosing, is used for highlights and emphasis.

Options
-------

Open the Aurora options from the in-game addon options, or type /aurora.
